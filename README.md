# mySudokuProject
Basically a small aside of school project where my goal is to create a suduko solver using a backtracking algoritm. 
The sudoku solver is now working as aspected
At the moment it is just a Console app where the user can put in a suduko puzzle one row at a time where 0 represtents to unfilld squares,
the user input should be done nicer. 

Maybe i will make a WebApplication for the input instead but my goal with this project was to get the hang of backtracking, which is done. So
now this will rest for a bit
